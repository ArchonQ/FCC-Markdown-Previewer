# FCC-Markdown-Previewer

FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects 1-5

Project #2: **Markdown Previewer**

## FreeCodeCamp Project Requirements:

### Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

### User Story #1:

I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

### User Story #2:

I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

### User Story #3:

When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

### User Story #4:

When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

### User Story #5:

When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

### User Story #6:

When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

### User Story #7:

On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

### User Story #8:

When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

### User Story #9:

My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

### User Story #10:

I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quotea element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

### User Story #11:

The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
